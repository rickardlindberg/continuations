The purpose of this repository is to learn about the continuation passing
style, and specifically how one can implement such a language in C.

# Step 1

The first thing I did was to get a feel for how continuation passing style
works. I did this by experimenting with it in Haskell (Learning.hs).

# Step 2

Next I imagined there was a compiler to C from a continuation passing style
language and I tried to implement that in C (hello-world.c).

# Step 3

The hello world program was quite simple and there was no need for an
environment. I tried to do the same thing with a program that calculates
pythagoras (pythagoras.c).
